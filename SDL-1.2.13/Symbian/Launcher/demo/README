
 Parallax Scrolling II - Various Features
 ----------------------------------------

	This SDL example program
	demonstrates multilayer,
	multidirectional parallax
	scrolling with multiple,
	independent maps and
	various other features.


The program scrolls three parallax layers around
the screen, each with it's own map. The code is
somewhat object oriented, but quite simple -
there are no tricky optimizations or clever tricks.


The program supports a few command line options:

	-f	Fullscreen
	-d	Double buffer
	-<n>	Depth = <n> bits
