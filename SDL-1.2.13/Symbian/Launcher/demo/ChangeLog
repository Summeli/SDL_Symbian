David Olofson - "Parallax Scrolling Example 2"

	+ Created C style "class" tiled_layer_t.

	+ " " in the map == no tile.

	+ Added a third parallax layer with it's own map.

	+ The background got a map.

	+ Removed the confusing initialization of the
	  destination SDL_Rect size in draw_tile()...

	+ Added vertical scrolling; map size 16x16.

	+ Corrected my bounce code! (Moving back to the
	  previous position is wrong*. "Mirroring" over
	  the limit is the correct way. Silly me... :-)

	+ Tweaked the graphics a bit. The planet is now
	  circular rather than 320x200 ratio compensated.

	+ Rewrote the rendering loop in a (hopefully)
	  more comprehensible way.

	+ Exit handled more properly.

	+ Command line options added:
		-f	Fullscreen
		-d	Double buffer
		-<n>	Depth = <n> bits


Randi J. Relander - "Parallax Scrolling Example"

	+ Added simple 2-layer parallax scrolling with
	  layer velocities expressed in pixels/sec.


David Olofson - "Tiled Map Scrolling Example"

	+ Added a simple map, and replaced the image with
	  a tile palette. Graphics borrowed from David's
	  (so far) unreleased game "Project Spitfire".

	+ Fixed atexit() bug.


Nghia - "Simple Scrolling Example"

	+ Basic continuous scrolling of an image.
